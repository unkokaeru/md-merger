# Antiderivatives and Indefinite Integrals

## Introduction
Antiderivatives and indefinite integrals are foundational concepts in calculus, crucial for understanding areas under curves and solving differential equations. These concepts are closely related, yet distinct, in their applications and interpretations.

### Antiderivatives
An antiderivative of a function $f(x)$ is a function $F(x)$ whose derivative is $f(x)$. In other words, $F'(x) = f(x)$. The process of finding antiderivatives is often called anti-differentiation.

### Indefinite Integrals
The indefinite integral of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ is a collection of all its antiderivatives and is denoted as $\int f(x) \, dx$. It includes a constant of integration, $C$, because the derivative of a constant is zero.

## Relation between Antiderivatives and Indefinite Integrals
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus bridges the concept of antiderivatives and integrals. It states that if $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$ on an interval $I$, then $\int f(x) \, dx = F(x) + C$ for all $x$ in $I$.

## Examples
1. **Linear Functions:** If $f(x) = ax + b$, an antiderivative is $F(x) = \frac{1}{2}ax^2 + bx + C$.
2. **Exponential Functions:** For $f(x) = e^x$, the antiderivative is $F(x) = e^x + C$.

## Applications
1. **Area under Curves:** Indefinite integrals are used to calculate the area under curves.
2. **Solving Differential Equations:** Antiderivatives are key in solving ordinary differential equations.
