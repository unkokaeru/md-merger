# Asymptotes

## Introduction
Asymptotes are lines that a graph approaches but never actually reaches. These occur in many types of functions and are crucial in understanding the behaviour of graphs, especially as the independent variable grows large or small.

## Types of Asymptotes
There are three main types of asymptotes:

### 1. Horizontal Asymptotes
These occur when the graph of a function approaches a particular y-value as x tends to infinity or negative infinity. Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the end behaviour of the function.

#### Example:
Consider $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$. As $x$ approaches infinity, $f(x)$ approaches 0. Hence, the x-axis (y=0) is a horizontal asymptote.

### 2. Vertical Asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur when a function approaches infinity or negative infinity as the x-value approaches a particular number. This typically happens where the function is undefined.

#### Example:
For $g(x) = \frac{1}{x-1}$, as $x$ approaches 1, $g(x)$ approaches infinity. Thus, the line x=1 is a vertical asymptote.

### 3. Oblique (Slant) Asymptotes
These occur when the graph of a function approaches a line that is not horizontal as $x$ tends to infinity or negative infinity. They are common in rational functions where the degree of the numerator is one more than the degree of the denominator.

#### Example:
The function $h(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x}$ has the oblique asymptote y = x, as the graph approaches this line for large values of $x$.

## Finding Asymptotes
To find asymptotes, one typically analyses the limits of the function as $x$ approaches certain critical values or infinity. For rational functions, polynomial division can also be used to identify oblique asymptotes.

## Historical Context
The concept of asymptotes dates back to Apollonius of Perga, an ancient Greek geometer and astronomer, who discussed the idea in terms of conic sections. The term "asymptote" comes from Greek, meaning "not falling together".

## Test Questions
1. Determine the horizontal and vertical asymptotes of $f(x) = \frac{2x}{x-3}$.
2. Does the function $g(x) = x^3 - 3x + 2$ have any asymptotes? Justify your answer.
3. Find the oblique asymptote of $h(x) = \frac{x^2 + 2x + 3}{x}$.
