# Basic Complex Arithmetic

## Introduction
Complex numbers are a fundamental concept in mathematics, extending the real numbers and providing solutions to equations that have no real solutions. A complex number is defined as a number of the form $a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and $i$ is the imaginary unit with the property $i^2 = -1$.

## Definition and Representation
- **Real Part:** In a complex number $a + bi$, the term $a$ is the real part.
- **Imaginary Part:** The term $b$ is the imaginary part.
- **Imaginary Unit:** $i$ is defined such that $i^2 = -1$.

### Visual Representation
Complex numbers can be represented on a plane known as the Argand plane or complex plane, where the horizontal axis represents the real part and the vertical axis represents the imaginary part.

## Basic Operations
1. **Addition:** $(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i$.
2. **Subtraction:** $(a + bi) - (c + di) = (a - c) + (b - d)i$.
3. **Multiplication:** $(a + bi)(c + di) = ac + adi + bci + bdi^2 = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i$.
4. **Division:** For $c + di \neq 0$, $\frac{a + bi}{c + di} = \frac{(a + bi)(c - di)}{c^2 + d^2}$.

### Conjugate
The conjugate of a complex number $a + bi$ is $a - bi$. It is useful in division and in finding the magnitude of a complex number.

### Magnitude
The magnitude (or modulus) of a complex number $a + bi$ is $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.

## Historical Context
The concept of complex numbers emerged in the 16th century, initially in the context of solving cubic equations. Mathematicians like Gerolamo Cardano and Rafael Bombelli contributed to their development.

## Examples
1. **Addition Example:** $(3 + 2i) + (1 + 4i) = 4 + 6i$.
2. **Multiplication Example:** $(2 + 3i)(1 + 2i) = 2 + 4i + 3i + 6i^2 = -4 + 7i$.

## Conclusion and Test Questions
Understanding basic complex arithmetic is crucial for delving deeper into complex analysis and its applications in engineering, physics, and other sciences.
