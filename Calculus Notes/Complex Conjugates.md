# Complex Conjugates

## Introduction
Complex numbers, a fundamental concept in mathematics, are used to solve equations that do not have real solutions. A complex number is typically written in the form $a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and $i$ is the imaginary unit with the property $i^2 = -1$. 

## Definition of Complex Conjugate
The complex conjugate of a complex number is obtained by changing the sign of the imaginary part. Therefore, the complex conjugate of $a + bi$ is $a - bi$. This operation is crucial in various mathematical processes, such as simplifying the division of complex numbers.

## Properties
1. **Reflection**: The complex conjugate of $a + bi$ reflects the point across the real axis in the complex plane.
2. **Multiplication**: The product of a complex number and its conjugate is always a non-negative real number: $(a + bi)(a - bi) = a^2 + b^2$.
3. **Modulus**: The modulus of a complex number, given by $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$, is related to its conjugate. It can be computed as the square root of the product of a complex number and its conjugate.
4. **Addition and Subtraction**: The sum and difference of a complex number and its conjugate are real numbers. The sum $(a + bi) + (a - bi)$ is $2a$, and the difference is $2bi$.

## Applications
- **Simplifying Expressions**: In division, multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator simplifies the expression.
- **Solving Equations**: In quadratic equations with complex solutions, the roots are conjugates of each other.
- **Signal Processing**: Complex conjugates are used in signal processing and in the representation of waves.

## Historical Context
The concept of complex conjugates emerged alongside the development of complex numbers in the 16th century, primarily as a tool for solving cubic equations.

## Example
Consider the complex number $3 + 4i$. Its complex conjugate is $3 - 4i$. The product of these numbers is $(3 + 4i)(3 - 4i) = 9 + 16 = 25$, which is a real number.
