# Continuity over an Interval

## Introduction
Continuity is a fundamental concept in calculus, representing the idea that a function does not have any "jumps," "breaks," or "holes" in its graph. When we talk about a function being continuous over an interval, we mean that for every point within this interval, the function does not exhibit any of these disruptions.

## Definition
A function $f(x)$ is said to be continuous on an interval if it is continuous at every point in that interval. More formally, for any $c$ in the interval:

1. **Existence**: The function $f(x)$ is defined at $c$.
2. **Limit Existence**: The limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $c$ exists.
3. **Limit Equals Function**: The limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $c$ is equal to $f(c)$.

Mathematically, this is expressed as:
$$\lim_{{x \to c}} f(x) = f(c)$$

## Types of Intervals
There are different types of intervals, including open, closed, and half-open intervals. For example, an open interval $(a, b)$ does not include the end points $a$ and $b$, while a closed interval $[a, b]$ includes both $a$ and $b$.

## Historical Context
The formal definition of continuity was developed in the 19th century by mathematicians like Augustin-Louis Cauchy and Karl Weierstrass. This development was part of a broader effort to rigorize calculus, which was initially based on intuitive notions of continuity and infinitesimals.

## Examples
1. **Polynomial Functions**: All polynomial functions are continuous over any interval. For instance, the function $f(x) = x^2$ is continuous for all real numbers.
2. **Rational Functions**: A rational function, such as $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$, is continuous everywhere except where the denominator is zero. For $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$, the function is not continuous at $x = 0$.

## Application
Understanding continuity over an interval is crucial for various mathematical concepts like integration. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, for instance, requires the integrand to be continuous over the interval of integration.

## Test Questions
1. Is the function $g(x) = \frac{x}{x-2}$ continuous over the interval $(1, 3)$? Explain why or why not.
2. For the function $h(x) = |x|$, determine if it is continuous over the interval $[-1, 1]$. Provide reasoning.
3. Find an example of a function that is continuous over a closed interval $[a, b]$ and explain your choice.
