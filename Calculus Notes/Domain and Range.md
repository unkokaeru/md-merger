# Domain and Range

## Introduction
The concepts of domain and range are fundamental in mathematics, particularly in the study of functions. Understanding these concepts is crucial for anyone studying undergraduate mathematics, as they form the basis for further exploration in calculus, algebra, and beyond.

## Domain
The domain of a function refers to the set of all possible input values (usually represented as x-values) for which the function is defined. It is essentially the collection of all inputs over which the function can operate.

### Examples
1. For a linear function like $f(x) = 2x + 3$, the domain is all real numbers, since you can input any real number and get a real number as output.
2. For the function $g(x) = \frac{1}{x}$, the domain is all real numbers except zero, as division by zero is undefined.

## Range
The range of a function refers to the set of all possible output values (usually represented as y-values) that the function can produce. It is the collection of all outputs that result from using the domain elements as inputs in the function.

### Examples
1. For $f(x) = 2x + 3$, the range is also all real numbers, as the output can be any real number depending on the input.
2. For $h(x) = \sqrt{x}$, the range is all non-negative real numbers, as the square root of a real number cannot be negative.

## Historical Context
The concepts of domain and range were developed as mathematicians began to understand functions more deeply. They are integral to the Cartesian coordinate system, conceptualized by Ren√© Descartes, where the domain and range represent the x and y-axes, respectively.

## Test Questions
1. STARTI [Basic] Question: What is the domain of the function $f(x) = \frac{1}{x-2}$? Back: All real numbers except 2, because the function is undefined at $x = 2$. ENDI
2. STARTI [Basic] Question: If a function's range is all non-negative real numbers, can it be a linear function? Back: No, a linear function has a range of all real numbers, not just non-negative ones. ENDI
3. STARTI [Basic] Question: How does the concept of domain differ from that of range in a function? Back: The domain consists of all possible input values, while the range consists of all possible output values. ENDI

Understanding domain and range sets the foundation for exploring more complex mathematical concepts and functions. For further exploration, consider creating notes on specific types of functions, such as quadratic or exponential, and examining their domains and ranges.
