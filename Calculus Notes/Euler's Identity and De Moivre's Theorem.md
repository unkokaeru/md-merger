# Euler's Identity and De Moivre's Theorem

## Introduction

Euler's Identity and De Moivre's Theorem are two fundamental concepts in mathematics, specifically in the field of complex analysis. Both play a crucial role in linking trigonometry, exponential functions, and complex numbers.

## Euler's Identity

### Definition
Euler's Identity is an elegant equation that establishes a deep relationship between the most fundamental numbers in mathematics:

$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$

Here, $e$ is the base of natural logarithms, $i$ is the imaginary unit, and $\pi$ is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

### Significance
This identity is celebrated for its beauty and simplicity, as it combines five fundamental mathematical constants:
1. The number 0.
2. The number 1.
3. The number $\pi$ (Pi).
4. The number $e$ (Euler's Number).
5. The number $i$ (the imaginary unit).

## De Moivre's Theorem

### Definition
De Moivre's Theorem provides a formula for raising complex numbers to any power $n$ (where $n$ is an integer). It states that for any complex number $z$ (written in polar form as $r(\cos \theta + i\sin \theta)$), and any integer $n$, the following holds:

$$[r(\cos \theta + i\sin \theta)]^n = r^n (\cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta))$$

### Applications
This theorem is particularly useful for:
- Calculating powers of complex numbers.
- Simplifying the computation of roots of complex numbers.

## Historical Context

### Euler
Leonhard Euler, a Swiss mathematician and physicist, made numerous contributions to various areas of mathematics, including the introduction of Euler's formula, of which Euler's Identity is a special case.

### De Moivre
Abraham de Moivre, a French mathematician, is known for his work in trigonometry, particularly for De Moivre's Theorem, which he formulated in the 18th century.

## Examples

1. **Euler's Identity Example:**
   To see Euler's Identity in action, simply substitute $\pi$ for $\theta$ in Euler's formula:
   $$e^{i\pi} = \cos(\pi) + i\sin(\pi) = -1$$
   Adding 1 to both sides gives Euler's Identity.

2. **De Moivre's Theorem Example:**
   Consider $z = 1 + i$ (where $r = \sqrt{2}$ and $\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}$). Using De Moivre's Theorem to find $z^3$, we get:
   $$(1 + i)^3 = (\sqrt{2})^3 \left(\cos\left(3 \times \frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i\sin\left(3 \times \frac{\pi}{4}\right)\right)$$

1. STARTI [Basic] Question: What is Euler's Identity? Back: Euler's Identity is $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$. ENDI
2. STARTI [Basic] Question: State De Moivre's Theorem for a complex number $z$ and integer $n$. Back: De Moivre's Theorem states that $[r(\cos \theta + i\sin \theta)]^n = r^n (\cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta))$. ENDI
3. STARTI [Basic] Question: Using Euler's formula, show how Euler's Identity is derived. Back: By substituting $\theta = \pi$ in Euler's formula, $e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta)$, we get $e^{i\pi} = \cos(\pi) + i\sin(\pi) = -1$, leading to Euler's Identity. ENDI
