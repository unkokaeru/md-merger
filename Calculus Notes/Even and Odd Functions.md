# Even and Odd Functions

## Introduction
Even and odd functions are fundamental concepts in mathematics, particularly in the study of functions in calculus and algebra. Understanding these types of functions aids in graph analysis, problem-solving, and understanding symmetry in mathematical contexts.

## Definitions

### Even Functions
A function $f(x)$ is called an **even function** if for every number $x$ in the function's domain, $f(-x) = f(x)$. This means that the graph of an even function is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. A classic example of an even function is $f(x) = x^2$.

### Odd Functions
A function $f(x)$ is considered an **odd function** if for every $x$ in the function's domain, $f(-x) = -f(x)$. Odd functions exhibit symmetry about the origin. The function $f(x) = x^3$ is a standard example of an odd function.

## Properties and Examples

### Even Functions
- **Symmetry:** Symmetric about the y-axis.
- **Zeroes:** If they exist, occur in symmetric pairs.
- **Integral Property:** The integral of an even function over a symmetric interval $[-a, a]$ is twice the integral from 0 to $a$.
- **Examples:** $f(x) = x^2, \cos(x), |x|$.

### Odd Functions
- **Symmetry:** Symmetric about the origin.
- **Zeroes:** Always include $x = 0$ (if the domain includes 0).
- **Integral Property:** The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is 0.
- **Examples:** $f(x) = x^3, \sin(x), x(1 - x^2)$.

## Historical Context
The concepts of even and odd functions were developed as part of the study of polynomial functions and later extended to more complex functions. These concepts are crucial in Fourier analysis, where functions are expressed as a sum of sine and cosine terms (odd and even functions, respectively).

## Applications
- **Physics:** Describing waveforms and harmonic oscillations.
- **Engineering:** Signal processing and symmetrical component analysis.
- **Mathematics:** Simplifying integrals, solving differential equations.
