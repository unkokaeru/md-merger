# Exponential Functions

## Overview
Exponential functions are a cornerstone of mathematics, frequently appearing in various disciplines like physics, economics, and biology. Their general form is $f(x) = a \cdot b^x$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants, and $b$ is positive and not equal to 1. The variable $x$ is typically real-valued.

## Characteristics
1. **Base $b$**: It determines the rate of growth or decay. If $b > 1$, the function models exponential growth, while $0 < b < 1$ models exponential decay.
2. **Coefficient $a$**: This constant affects the initial value of the function. If $a > 0$, the function is always positive, and if $a < 0$, the function takes on negative values.
3. **Asymptotic behaviour**: Exponential functions approach zero but never reach it, forming an asymptote at $y = 0$.
4. **Growth Rate**: Exponential growth is characterized by the rate of change increasing over time, unlike linear growth where the rate is constant.

## Applications
Exponential functions are widely used in various fields:
- **Finance**: Calculating compound interest.
- **Biology**: modelling population growth or decay.
- **Physics**: Radioactive decay and cooling processes.

## Historical Context
The concept of exponential growth first appeared in the work of John Napier in the early 17th century, focusing on logarithms and their properties. Exponential functions were later formalized by Euler in the 18th century, who also introduced the constant $e \approx 2.71828$, now known as Euler's number, a fundamental base of natural logarithms and exponential functions.

## Examples
1. Compound Interest: If $P$ is the principal amount, $r$ the interest rate, and $t$ the time in years, the future value $A$ is given by $A = P \cdot e^{rt}$.
2. Population Growth: If $P_0$ is the initial population, and $r$ is the growth rate, the population after $t$ years is $P(t) = P_0 \cdot e^{rt}$.

## Test Questions
1. What is the general form of an exponential function?
   - Back: $f(x) = a \cdot b^x$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants and $b > 0, b \neq 1$.

2. If a population doubles every 5 years, what is the exponential growth model?
   - Back: $P(t) = P_0 \cdot 2^{t/5}$, where $P_0$ is the initial population and $t$ is time in years.

3. Calculate the future value of a $1000 investment after 10 years at an annual interest rate of 5%, compounded continuously.
   - Back: $A = 1000 \cdot e^{0.05 \times 10} \approx 1648.72$.
