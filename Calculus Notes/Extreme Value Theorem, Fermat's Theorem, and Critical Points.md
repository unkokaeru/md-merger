# Extreme Value Theorem, Fermat's Theorem, and Critical Points

## Extreme Value Theorem (EVT)

### Overview
The Extreme Value Theorem is a fundamental theorem in calculus which states that if a function $f$ is continuous on a closed interval $[a, b]$, then $f$ must attain a maximum and a minimum, at least once each, on $[a, b]$.

### Historical Context
Developed as part of the foundational work in calculus, EVT has roots in the ideas of mathematicians like Bernard Bolzano and Karl Weierstrass, who were pivotal in formalizing concepts of continuity and limits.

### Application
EVT is crucial in optimization problems where finding maximum and minimum values is essential, such as in economics, engineering, and physics.

## Fermat's Theorem on Stationary Points

### Overview
Fermat's Theorem states that if a function $f$ has a local maximum or minimum at a point $c$ and $f$ is differentiable at $c$, then the derivative of $f$ at $c$ is zero, i.e., $f'(c) = 0$.

### Historical Context
Named after Pierre de Fermat, a 17th-century mathematician, this theorem plays a crucial role in identifying potential extrema, particularly in the field of calculus of variations.

### Application
Fermat's Theorem is used in finding local extrema (maximum or minimum values) of differentiable functions, an essential process in fields such as economics, physics, and engineering optimization.

## Critical Points

### Overview
Critical points of a function are points where the function's derivative is either zero or undefined. These are potential candidates for being local maxima or minima of the function.

### Application
Identifying critical points is a fundamental step in graphing functions and solving optimization problems in various scientific and engineering fields.
