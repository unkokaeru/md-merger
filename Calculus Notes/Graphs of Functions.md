# Graphs of Functions

## Introduction
The graph of a function is a visual representation of the relationship between its inputs (usually denoted as $x$) and outputs (denoted as $y$ or $f(x)$). It's an essential concept in mathematics, particularly in calculus and analysis, as it helps in understanding the behaviour of functions.

## Definition
A graph of a function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is the set of ordered pairs $(x, f(x))$ where $x$ is in the domain of $f$. In the Cartesian coordinate system, these pairs are represented as points in a two-dimensional plane.

## Characteristics
1. **Domain and Range**: The domain of a function is the set of all possible inputs, while the range is the set of all possible outputs. The graph shows the extent of these in the $x$- and $y$-axes respectively.
2. **Continuity**: A function is continuous if its graph can be drawn without lifting the pencil from the paper.
3. **Asymptotes**: These are lines that the graph of a function approaches but never touches.
4. **Intercepts**: Points where the graph intersects the axes. The $x$-intercept is where $f(x) = 0$, and the $y$-intercept is where $x = 0$.
5. **Slope and Concavity**: Indicate the rate of change and the direction of the curve, respectively.

## Types of Graphs
1. **Linear**: Straight line graph, indicating a constant rate of change.
2. **Quadratic**: Parabolic graph, representing polynomial functions of degree 2.
3. **Exponential**: Rapidly increasing or decreasing graph, common in growth and decay problems.
4. **Logarithmic**: The inverse of exponential functions, useful in scenarios involving logarithmic scales.
5. **Trigonometric**: Representing functions like sine, cosine, and tangent, these graphs are periodic.

## Historical Context
The use of graphs to represent functions dates back to the 17th century, with significant contributions from mathematicians like Ren√© Descartes and Isaac Newton. The Cartesian coordinate system, named after Descartes, is fundamental in graphing functions.

## Example: Graphing a Linear Function
Consider the linear function $f(x) = 2x + 3$. Its graph can be plotted by finding two points that satisfy the equation and drawing a line through them. For example, when $x = 0$, $y = 3$ and when $x = 1$, $y = 5$.

## Test Questions
1. **Question:** What is the range of the function $f(x) = x^2$ when the domain is $x \geq 0$? **Back:** The range is $y \geq 0$ because a square of a non-negative number is always non-negative.
2. **Question:** How do you identify a function's $y$-intercept on its graph? **Back:** The $y$-intercept is the point where the graph crosses the $y$-axis, which occurs when $x = 0$.
3. **Question:** What does the slope of a function's graph represent? **Back:** The slope represents the rate of change of the function.
