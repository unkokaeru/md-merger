# Implicit Differentiation Using Partial Derivatives

## Introduction
Implicit differentiation is a technique used in calculus to find the derivative of an implicitly defined function. Unlike explicit functions where $y$ is given explicitly as a function of $x$ (e.g., $y = f(x)$), implicit functions are presented in a form where $y$ cannot be easily isolated (e.g., $F(x, y) = 0$). 

When dealing with such functions, we often use partial derivatives to facilitate the process of differentiation. This approach is particularly useful in multivariable calculus, where functions are defined in terms of more than one variable.

## Conceptual Overview
In implicit differentiation, we differentiate both sides of an equation with respect to $x$ while treating $y$ as a function of $x$. This involves applying the chain rule for derivatives. The general process is as follows:

1. **Differentiate Both Sides**: Given an equation $F(x, y) = 0$, differentiate both sides with respect to $x$, treating $y$ as a function of $x$.

2. **Apply the Chain Rule**: When differentiating terms involving $y$, apply the chain rule. This means that for each occurrence of $y$, you'll add a term involving $\frac{dy}{dx}$.

3. **Solve for $\frac{dy}{dx}$**: After differentiating, you'll have an equation involving $\frac{dy}{dx}$. Solve this equation to find the derivative.

## Example
Consider the circle defined by the equation $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$, where $r$ is the radius.

Differentiating implicitly, we get:
$$2x + 2y\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$$

Solving for $\frac{dy}{dx}$, we find:
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}$$

This formula gives the slope of the tangent line to the circle at any point $(x, y)$.

## Historical Context
Implicit differentiation has been a fundamental tool in calculus since the time of Leibniz and Newton. Its development was crucial in solving complex geometrical problems and in the advancement of differential equations.

## Test Questions
1. STARTI [Basic] Question: What is the implicit derivative of $x^2 + xy + y^2 = 7$ with respect to $x$? Back: $2x + y + x\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$. ENDI
2. STARTI [Basic] Question: For the ellipse $\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$, find $\frac{dy}{dx}$ at any point. Back: Differentiating implicitly, $\frac{2x}{a^2} + \frac{2y}{b^2}\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$. Solving for $\frac{dy}{dx}$, we get $\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{b^2x}{a^2y}$. ENDI
3. STARTI [Basic] Question: Explain how the chain rule is applied in implicit differentiation. Back: In implicit differentiation, when a term involves $y$, which is a function of $x$, the chain rule is applied. This results in an additional $\frac{dy}{dx}$ term for each $y$-containing term during differentiation. ENDI
