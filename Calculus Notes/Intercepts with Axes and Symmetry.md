# Intercepts with Axes and Symmetry
## Introduction

In mathematics, understanding the concepts of intercepts and symmetry is crucial, especially in the study of functions and graphs. These concepts are fundamental in algebra, calculus, and other areas of mathematics, providing insights into the behavior of functions and their graphical representations.

## Intercepts with Axes

### Definition

**X-intercept:** A point where the graph of a function or an equation crosses the x-axis. At this point, the y-coordinate is zero.

**Y-intercept:** A point where the graph of a function or an equation crosses the y-axis. Here, the x-coordinate is zero.

### Finding Intercepts

- **X-intercept:** Set $y = 0$ in the equation and solve for $x$.
- **Y-intercept:** Set $x = 0$ in the equation and solve for $y$.

#### Example

Consider the linear equation $y = 2x + 3$:
- X-intercept: Set $y = 0$, $0 = 2x + 3$ ⇒ $x = -\frac{3}{2}$.
- Y-intercept: Set $x = 0$, $y = 2(0) + 3$ ⇒ $y = 3$.

## Symmetry

### Types of Symmetry

1. **Axial Symmetry:** The graph is symmetrical about a line (usually the y-axis or x-axis).
2. **Origin Symmetry:** The graph is symmetrical about the origin.

### Testing for Symmetry

- **Y-axis Symmetry:** Replace $x$ with $-x$ in the equation. If the equation remains unchanged, the graph is symmetric about the y-axis.
- **Origin Symmetry:** Replace $x$ with $-x$ and $y$ with $-y$. If the equation remains unchanged, the graph is symmetric about the origin.

#### Example

Consider the equation $y = x^2$:
- Replacing $x$ with $-x$ gives $y = (-x)^2 = x^2$, so it's symmetric about the y-axis.

2. STARTI [Basic] Question: What does it mean if a graph is symmetric about the y-axis? Back: It means that for every point $(x, y)$ on the graph, there is a corresponding point $(-x, y)$ also on the graph. ENDI
3. STARTI [Basic] Question: If a function's equation remains unchanged when $x$ is replaced with $-x$ and $y$ is replaced with $-y$, what type of symmetry does the graph exhibit? Back: The graph exhibits origin symmetry. ENDI
