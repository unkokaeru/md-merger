# Logarithmic Differentiation

Logarithmic differentiation is a powerful technique in calculus, especially useful for differentiating products, quotients, and powers where traditional rules of differentiation like the product rule and quotient rule are cumbersome. This method involves taking the natural logarithm of both sides of an equation and then differentiating.

## Concept and Process

1. **Taking Logarithms**: Given a function $y = f(x)$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides: $\ln(y) = \ln(f(x))$.
2. **Applying Properties of Logarithms**: Utilize the properties of logarithms to simplify the equation. For instance, $\ln(a \cdot b) = \ln(a) + \ln(b)$, and $\ln(a^b) = b \ln(a)$.
3. **Differentiating**: Differentiate both sides with respect to $x$. Remember that $\frac{d}{dx}[\ln(y)] = \frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx}$.
4. **Solving for $\frac{dy}{dx}$**: Rearrange and solve for $\frac{dy}{dx}$.

## Applications

Logarithmic differentiation is particularly useful in cases where direct differentiation is not straightforward, such as:

- Functions with variable bases and exponents, e.g., $y = x^x$.
- Complex products and quotients, e.g., $y = \frac{x^2 \cdot \sin(x)}{\sqrt{e^x + 3}}$.

## Example

Consider $y = x^x$. Applying logarithmic differentiation:

1. Take logarithms: $\ln(y) = \ln(x^x)$.
2. Simplify using log properties: $\ln(y) = x \ln(x)$.
3. Differentiate both sides: $\frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx} = \ln(x) + x \cdot \frac{1}{x}$.
4. Solve for $\frac{dy}{dx}$: $\frac{dy}{dx} = y(\ln(x) + 1) = x^x(\ln(x) + 1)$.
