# Maxima and Minima Values

## Overview

Maxima and minima, fundamental concepts in calculus and mathematical analysis, refer to the highest and lowest values of a function within a given range. These points are crucial in various fields such as physics, engineering, economics, and optimization problems. 

## Historical Context

The concept of maxima and minima dates back to ancient times, with notable contributions from mathematicians like Fermat and Newton. Fermat's method of adequality in the early 17th century laid the groundwork for calculus, while Newton's method of fluxions provided a formal approach to finding these values.

## Definitions

1. **Local Maximum**: A function $f(x)$ has a local maximum at $x = a$ if $f(a)$ is greater than every value of $f(x)$ near $a$.
2. **Local Minimum**: Similarly, $f(x)$ has a local minimum at $x = a$ if $f(a)$ is less than every value of $f(x)$ near $a$.
3. **Global (or Absolute) Maximum/Minimum**: These are the highest and lowest values of the function over its entire domain.

## Finding Maxima and Minima

1. **Derivative Test**: If $f'(a) = 0$ and $f''(a) > 0$, $f(a)$ is a local minimum. If $f''(a) < 0$, it's a local maximum.
2. **Critical Points**: Points where $f'(x) = 0$ or $f'(x)$ does not exist are critical points, potential candidates for maxima or minima.
3. **Endpoints**: In a closed interval, the absolute maxima and minima can occur at endpoints or critical points within the interval.

## Applications

Maxima and minima are extensively used in optimizing resources, designing structures, financial modelling, and in the study of natural phenomena.

## Example

Consider the function $f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 4$. To find its minima or maxima:

1. Derivative: $f'(x) = 2x - 4$.
2. Critical Point: Set $f'(x) = 0$, so $x = 2$.
3. Second Derivative: $f''(x) = 2$, which is positive.
4. Conclusion: $f(x)$ has a local and absolute minimum at $x = 2$.

2. Determine the absolute maximum and minimum values of $f(x) = \sin(x)$ in the interval $[0, 2\pi]$.
3. For the function $f(x) = e^{-x} \cos(x)$, identify the critical points and classify them.
