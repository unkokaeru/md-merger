# Modulus and Argument

## Introduction
Complex numbers, denoted as a + bi where a and b are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit (satisfying $i^2 = -1$), form a fundamental part of mathematics, especially in fields like engineering, physics, and applied mathematics. Understanding the modulus and argument of complex numbers is crucial for visualizing and manipulating them in the complex plane.

## Modulus
The modulus of a complex number $z = a + bi$ is its absolute value and is represented by |z|. It is defined as the distance of the complex number from the origin in the complex plane. Mathematically, the modulus is given by:

$$|z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$

This formula arises from the Pythagorean theorem, considering $a$ and $b$ as the legs of a right triangle.

### Example
For $z = 3 + 4i$, the modulus $|z|$ is calculated as:

$$|3 + 4i| = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5$$

## Argument
The argument of a complex number $z = a + bi$ is the angle $\theta$ formed with the positive direction of the x-axis. The argument is typically denoted as $\arg(z)$ and is measured in radians. The primary value of the argument lies in the interval $(-\pi, \pi]$. 

It is calculated using the formula:

$$\text{arg}(z) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)$$

### Example
For $z = 3 + 4i$, the argument is calculated as:

$$\text{arg}(3 + 4i) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)$$

This value would be in radians and can be converted to degrees if required.

## Visualization in the Complex Plane
In the complex plane, a complex number is represented as a point or a vector. The modulus represents the length of this vector, while the argument represents the angle it makes with the positive x-axis.

## Conclusion
The concepts of modulus and argument are crucial for understanding the geometric interpretation of complex numbers. They are instrumental in operations like multiplication and division of complex numbers.

### Test Questions
1. STARTI [Basic] Question: What is the modulus of the complex number $7 + 24i$? Back: $|7 + 24i| = \sqrt{7^2 + 24^2} = \sqrt{49 + 576} = \sqrt{625} = 25$. ENDI
2. STARTI [Basic] Question: Calculate the argument of the complex number $-4 + 3i$. Back: $\arg(-4 + 3i) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{-4}\right)$. This value will be in the second quadrant as the real part is negative and the imaginary part is positive. ENDI
3. STARTI [Basic] Question: If a complex number has a modulus of 10 and an argument of π/4, what is the complex number? Back: Using the polar form, the complex number is $10(\cos(π/4) + i\sin(π/4)) = 10\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) = 7.07 + 7.07i$ approximately. ENDI
