# Multivariable Functions

## Introduction
Multivariable functions are a fundamental concept in higher mathematics, especially in fields like calculus, physics, and engineering. Unlike a single-variable function, which has one input and one output, a multivariable function has multiple inputs. The most common are functions of two or three variables, but they can have any number of variables.

## Definition
A multivariable function is a function that has more than one input variable. For instance, a function f that takes two inputs x and y could be written as f(x, y). The output of this function depends on the combination of these inputs.

### Examples:
1. **Temperature Distribution in a Room**: The temperature at a point in a room can be a function of its x, y, and z coordinates: T(x, y, z).
2. **Economic Models**: An economic function might depend on multiple factors like investment, consumption, and interest rates: E(I, C, r).

## Graphical Representation
Graphically, a function of two variables can be represented as a surface in three-dimensional space. Each point (x, y, z) on this surface represents the value of the function f(x, y) = z.

## Partial Derivatives
An important aspect of multivariable functions is the concept of partial derivatives. A partial derivative is the derivative of a multivariable function with respect to one of its variables, holding the other variables constant. It shows how the function changes as one of the variables changes, keeping the others fixed.

### Example:
For f(x, y) = x² + y², the partial derivative with respect to x is 2x, and with respect to y is 2y.

## Applications
1. **Engineering**: Modeling physical systems like fluid dynamics.
2. **Economics**: Understanding how different economic factors interact.
3. **Optimization Problems**: Finding maxima and minima in multiple dimensions.

## Conclusion
Multivariable functions extend the concept of single-variable functions to multiple dimensions, providing a powerful tool for modeling complex systems in various scientific and engineering fields.
