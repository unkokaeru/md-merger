# Parametric Equations

## Introduction
Parametric equations are a way of defining a geometrical entity using parameters. Unlike the traditional Cartesian equations, where y is defined in terms of x or vice versa, parametric equations use an independent parameter, typically denoted as $t$, to express the coordinates of points on a curve.

## Understanding Parametric Equations
In a two-dimensional space, a pair of parametric equations can be represented as:
$$x = f(t)$$
$$y = g(t)$$
where $f(t)$ and $g(t)$ are functions of the parameter $t$.

### Example
Consider the circle with a radius $r$. The parametric equations are:
$$x = r \cos(t)$$
$$y = r \sin(t)$$
Here, $t$ represents the angle, in radians, from the positive x-axis to the point on the circle.

## Advantages of Parametric Equations
1. **Flexibility**: They can represent a wider variety of curves than Cartesian equations.
2. **Convenience in Calculations**: Easier to compute tangents, normals, and arc lengths.
3. **Motion Representation**: Useful in physics to represent the path of a moving object.

## Historical Context
Parametric equations have been around since the advent of analytical geometry in the 17th century. They gained prominence with the work of mathematicians like Ren√© Descartes and Pierre de Fermat.

## Application in Calculus
In calculus, parametric equations are used to:
- Find derivatives ($\frac{dy}{dx}$) using the chain rule.
- Compute the length of a curve.
- Evaluate the area under parametric curves.

## Example in Real World: Projectile Motion
In physics, the motion of a projectile is often represented using parametric equations:
$$x = v_0 \cos(\theta) t$$
$$y = v_0 \sin(\theta) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2$$
where $v_0$ is the initial velocity, $\theta$ is the launch angle, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

## Test Questions
1. STARTI [Basic] Question: What are the parametric equations for a circle of radius 3? Back: $x = 3 \cos(t)$, $y = 3 \sin(t)$. ENDI
2. STARTI [Basic] Question: How do you find the slope of a curve represented by parametric equations? Back: Use the formula $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy/dt}{dx/dt}$. ENDI
3. STARTI [Basic] Question: If a particle moves along the curve given by $x = t^2$, $y = t^3$, what is the velocity at $t = 2$? Back: Velocity vector $\vec{v} = (2t, 3t^2)$. At $t = 2$, $\vec{v} = (4, 12)$. ENDI
