# Piecewise-defined Functions

## Introduction

Piecewise-defined functions are unique in that they have different expressions for different parts of their domains. This allows for greater flexibility in defining functions that change behaviour over different intervals.

## Definition

A piecewise-defined function is a function that is defined by multiple sub-functions, each applying to a certain interval of the main function's domain. The general form is:

$$f(x) = \begin{cases} 
f_1(x) & \text{for } x \text{ in interval } I_1 \\
f_2(x) & \text{for } x \text{ in interval } I_2 \\
\vdots \\
f_n(x) & \text{for } x \text{ in interval } I_n 
\end{cases}$$

Each $f_i(x)$ represents a different rule or formula applied over a specific interval $I_i$.

## Examples

1. **Absolute Value Function**: 
   $$|x| = \begin{cases} 
   x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
   -x & \text{if } x < 0 
   \end{cases}$$

2. **Piecewise Linear Function**:
   $$f(x) = \begin{cases} 
   2x + 3 & \text{if } x < 1 \\
   5 & \text{if } x = 1 \\
   3x - 2 & \text{if } x > 1
   \end{cases}$$

## Properties

1. **Continuity**: A piecewise-defined function can be continuous or discontinuous. Continuity at the points where the function changes from one piece to another depends on the limits of the sub-functions as they approach these points.

2. **Differentiability**: Similar to continuity, a piecewise-defined function can be differentiable or not, depending on the behaviour of the sub-functions at the points where they meet.

3. **Domain and Range**: The domain is the set of all x-values for which the function is defined, and the range is the set of all possible y-values.

## Applications

Piecewise-defined functions are used in various fields, such as engineering, economics, and physics, to model situations where a system behaves differently under different conditions.

## Historical Context

The concept of piecewise-defined functions developed alongside the formalization of function theory in mathematics. They were instrumental in understanding complex phenomena that could not be modelled by a single, uniform rule.

## **Test Questions

1. Define a piecewise function that describes the following scenario: A taxi company charges a flat rate for the first 2 kilometres and then a different rate for each additional kilometre.
2. Is it possible for a piecewise-defined function to be continuous? Provide an example.
3. How do you determine the domain and range of a piecewise-defined function?

## Conclusion

Understanding piecewise-defined functions is essential in mathematics, as they provide a way to model complex, real-world scenarios that vary over different intervals. Their unique structure allows for the flexibility needed in many applications, making them a valuable tool in the mathematician's toolkit.
