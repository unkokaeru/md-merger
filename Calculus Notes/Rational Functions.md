# Rational Functions

## Definition
A **rational function** is a function of the form $f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$, where $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are polynomial functions and $Q(x) \neq 0$. The domain of a rational function includes all real numbers except those that make $Q(x)$ equal to zero.

## Characteristics
- **Asymptotes**: Vertical asymptotes occur at values of $x$ where $Q(x) = 0$, provided $P(x)$ does not also equal zero at these points. Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$.
- **Discontinuity**: Points where $Q(x) = 0$ are typically points of discontinuity.
- **Behavior at Infinity**: The behavior of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches infinity depends on the leading terms of $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$.

## Examples
1. $f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2}$ 
   - Notice the removable discontinuity at $x = 2$.
2. $g(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}$ 
   - This function has a horizontal asymptote at $y = 0$.

## Historical Context
Rational functions are a key component in the development of calculus and have been studied extensively since the time of Newton and Leibniz. They are crucial in understanding limits and derivatives.

## Test Questions
1. STARTI [Basic] Question: What is the domain of $f(x) = \frac{1}{x - 3}$? Back: All real numbers except $x = 3$. ENDI
2. STARTI [Basic] Question: For the function $g(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x^2 + x - 6}$, identify the vertical and horizontal asymptotes. Back: Vertical asymptotes at $x = 2$ and $x = -3$, Horizontal asymptote at $y = 1$. ENDI
3. STARTI [Basic] Question: Explain why the function $h(x) = \frac{x^3}{x^2 - 4}$ does not have a horizontal asymptote. Back: The degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator. ENDI
