# Rolle's Theorem and Mean Value Theorem

## Introduction

In the realm of calculus, two significant theorems that play a pivotal role are **Rolle's Theorem** and the **Mean Value Theorem**. These theorems are fundamental in understanding the behavior of functions and their derivatives. They provide essential insights into the relationship between a function and its rate of change.

## Rolle's Theorem

### Statement
Rolle's Theorem states that if a function $f(x)$ is continuous on a closed interval $[a, b]$ and differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$, and if $f(a) = f(b)$, then there exists at least one $c$ in the interval $(a, b)$ such that the derivative $f'(c) = 0$.

### Intuition
The theorem essentially tells us that for any smooth curve that starts and ends at the same height, there must be at least one point where the tangent to the curve is horizontal.

### Historical Context
Rolle's Theorem is named after Michel Rolle, a French mathematician who formulated the theorem in 1691. His work laid the groundwork for the development of calculus, particularly in the study of the behavior of functions.

## Mean Value Theorem

### Statement
The Mean Value Theorem (MVT) extends Rolle's Theorem. It states that if a function $f(x)$ is continuous on a closed interval $[a, b]$ and differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$, then there exists at least one $c$ in $(a, b)$ such that $f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$.

### Intuition
The MVT asserts that somewhere on the curve, there is a point where the tangent to the curve is parallel to the secant line connecting the endpoints of the interval.

### Historical Context
The Mean Value Theorem plays a central role in calculus and analysis. It is a generalization of Rolle's Theorem and was developed as part of the formalization of calculus.

## Examples

1. **Rolle's Theorem Example**: Consider $f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 4$ on the interval [0, 4]. Since $f(0) = f(4)$ and $f(x)$ is both continuous and differentiable on this interval, Rolle's Theorem applies. We find that $f'(x) = 2x - 4$, and setting $f'(c) = 0$, we find $c = 2$.

2. **Mean Value Theorem Example**: For $f(x) = x^2$ on the interval [1, 3], the function is continuous and differentiable. Applying MVT, we find that there exists a $c$ such that $f'(c) = \frac{f(3) - f(1)}{3 - 1}$. Calculating, we find $c = \sqrt{5}$.

## Conclusion and Test Questions

Understanding these theorems is crucial for comprehending more advanced concepts in calculus. They not only provide a method to analyze the behavior of functions but also lay the foundation for further studies in differential equations and analysis.

### Test Questions

1. STARTI [Basic] Question: State Rolle's Theorem. Back: Rolle's Theorem states that if a function $f(x)$ is continuous on a closed interval $[a, b]$ and differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$, and if $f(a) = f(b)$, then there exists at least one $c$ in $(a, b)$ such that $f'(c) = 0$. ENDI
2. STARTI [Basic] Question: What is the geometric interpretation of the Mean Value Theorem? Back: Geometrically, the Mean Value Theorem asserts that there is at least one point on the curve of the function where the tangent is parallel to the secant line connecting the endpoints of the interval. ENDI
3. STARTI [Basic] Question: Apply Rolle's Theorem to the function $f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x$ on the interval [0, 3]. Back: Rolle's Theorem applies as $f(x)$ is continuous and differentiable, and $f(0) = f(3) = 0$. The derivative is $f'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 2$. Setting $f'(c) = 0$ and solving, we find $c = 1$ or $c = \frac{2}{3}$. ENDI
