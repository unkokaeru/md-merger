# Roots of Complex Numbers

## Introduction
Complex numbers, a fundamental concept in mathematics, extend the idea of the number system to include the square roots of negative numbers. The most common form of a complex number is $a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and $i$ is the imaginary unit with the property $i^2 = -1$. 

## Roots of Complex Numbers
Finding the $n$-th roots of a complex number is a key operation. The $n$-th roots of a complex number $z$ are the solutions to the equation $x^n = z$. If $z$ is represented in polar form as $r(\cos \theta + i\sin \theta)$, where $r$ is the magnitude and $\theta$ the argument of $z$, its $n$-th roots can be found using De Moivre's Theorem. 

### De Moivre's Theorem
De Moivre's Theorem states that for any real number $\theta$ and any integer $n$, the following holds:

$$(\cos \theta + i\sin \theta)^n = \cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta)$$

Using this theorem, we can express the $n$-th roots of $z$ as:

$$z^{1/n} = r^{1/n} \left( \cos\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right) \right)$$

for $k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1$.

## Historical Context
The concept of complex numbers and their roots was initially met with skepticism. It was not until the 18th century that mathematicians like Abraham de Moivre and Leonhard Euler formalized these ideas, leading to significant developments in mathematics and physics.

## Examples
1. Find the square roots of $1 + i$.
2. Calculate the cube roots of $-8$.

## Test Questions
1. What is the polar form of the complex number $3 + 4i$?
2. Using De Moivre's Theorem, find the fourth roots of $16(\cos \pi + i\sin \pi)$.
3. Explain the significance of the argument $\theta$ in finding the roots of complex numbers.
