# Trigonometric Functions

Trigonometric functions are fundamental in mathematics, particularly in the fields of geometry, engineering, and physics. They relate the angles of a triangle to the lengths of its sides and have applications in periodic phenomena such as waves.

## Definition and Basic Concepts

### The Unit Circle
- The unit circle is a circle with a radius of one, centred at the origin of a coordinate plane.
- Any point on the unit circle can be represented as $(\cos \theta, \sin \theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle formed with the positive x-axis.

### Sine and Cosine Functions
- **Sine ($\sin$)**: In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse.
- **Cosine ($\cos$)**: The cosine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse.
- In the unit circle, $\sin \theta$ and $\cos \theta$ represent the y and x coordinates, respectively.

### Other Functions
- **Tangent ($\tan$)**: $\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}$.
- **Cotangent ($\cot$)**: $\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta}$.
- **Secant ($\sec$)**: $\sec \theta = \frac{1}{\cos \theta}$.
- **Cosecant ($\csc$)**: $\csc \theta = \frac{1}{\sin \theta}$.

## Properties and Identities

### Periodicity
- Sine and cosine functions are periodic with a period of $2\pi$.
- Tangent and cotangent functions have a period of $\pi$.

### Symmetry
- Sine is an odd function: $\sin(-\theta) = -\sin(\theta)$.
- Cosine is an even function: $\cos(-\theta) = \cos(\theta)$.

### Pythagorean Identity
- $\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$.

### Addition Formulas
- $\sin(a + b) = \sin a \cos b + \cos a \sin b$.
- $\cos(a + b) = \cos a \cos b - \sin a \sin b$.

## Applications

- **Circles and Oscillations**: Modelling circular motion and wave patterns.
- **Sound and Light Waves**: Describing wave properties like amplitude and frequency.
- **Architecture and Engineering**: Solving problems involving angles and distances.

## Test Questions

1. If $\cos \theta = \frac{1}{2}$ and $\theta$ is in the first quadrant, what is $\sin \theta$?
2. Prove that $\tan(\theta + \pi) = \tan \theta$.
3. What is the period of the function $f(x) = 3 \sin(2x + \pi)$?
